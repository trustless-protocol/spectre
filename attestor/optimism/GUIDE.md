# OP Stack Attestor — Operator Guide

Everything needed to deploy, configure, and operate the attestor. For the
component overview, code layout, and gRPC API, see the [README](README.md);
design rationale lives in the upcoming Ethereum L2 architecture doc.

## Quickstart

```bash
just build-attestor                    # binary at attestor/optimism/attestor — no cgo, no LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./attestor/optimism/attestor --config attestor/optimism/config.json
```

The binary reads its own config file (template: `attestor/optimism/config.example.json` —
the attestor no longer shares the relayer's `config.json`), consuming the
`op_source` modules and the `server` block. Minimal OP Mainnet config:

```json
{
  "modules": [
    {
      "name": "op_source",
      "src_chain": "op-mainnet",
      "config": {
        "l1_rpc_url": "https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com",
        "op_node_rpc_url": "http://127.0.0.1:9545",
        "dispute_game_factory": "0xe5965Ab5962eDc7477C8520243A95517CD252fA9",
        "respected_game_type": 8,
        "attestation_head": "finalized",
        "l2_chain_id": 10,
        "attestation_signing_key": "env:ATTESTOR_SIGNING_KEY",
        "state_path": "./op-mainnet.attested-roots.json"
      }
    }
  ],
  "server": { "address": "127.0.0.1", "port": 3000, "grpc_port": 3001 }
}
```

**Read `dispute_game_factory` and `respected_game_type` fresh from the
chain** — governance can change them, and a wrong game type silently skips
every proposal (visible as `games_ingested_total` rising while
`pending_games` stays 0):

```bash
cast call <OptimismPortal> 'disputeGameFactory()(address)'  --rpc-url $L1
cast call <OptimismPortal> 'respectedGameType()(uint32)'    --rpc-url $L1
```

(OP Mainnet, measured 2026-07-22: portal v5.6.1, game type **8** — not legacy
CANNON=0. Type-8 root claims commit to the standard v0 single-chain output
root, so the byte-compare applies unchanged.)

Or skip all of the above with the scripted bring-up:

```bash
L1_RPC_URL=https://... OP_NODE_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9545 \
L2_CHAIN_ID=10 ATTESTOR_SIGNING_KEY=<32-byte-ed25519-seed-hex> \
  ./scripts/local/run_op_attestor.sh
```

## Configuration reference

One `op_source` module per tracked chain; several sources run in one process.
`src_chain` (module-level) is the metrics label and gRPC key — must be unique,
as must `state_path` (both enforced at config load).

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `l1_rpc_url` | required | Ethereum L1 execution RPC (factory reads) |
| `op_node_rpc_url` | required | The verify-mode replica's op-node RPC |
| `dispute_game_factory` | required | L1 `DisputeGameFactory` address |
| `respected_game_type` | 0 | Only games of this type are verified; others counted + skipped |
| `attestation_head` | `finalized` | Gating head: `finalized` \| `safe` \| `unsafe` (see below) |
| `poll_interval_seconds` | 30 | Attestation-pass cadence |
| `state_path` | required | JSON state file (cursor, pending, rechecks, feed) |
| `l1_bootstrap_lookback_blocks` | 7200 | First-run ingest window (~24 h of L1 blocks) |
| `l1_ws_url` | off | Optional `DisputeGameCreated` wake hint; poll loop fully correct without it |
| `disable_derived_roots` | false | Turn off self-derived attestations (feed then depends on proposer cadence) |
| `derived_attestation_gap_blocks` | 150 | Min L2-block gap between derived attestations (150 ≈ 5 min) |
| `max_derived_roots` | 1000 | Confirmed derived entries kept (oldest pruned; game + provisional entries never pruned) |
| `l2_chain_id` | required | L2 chain ID included in every signature's domain; it must equal the Cosmos client profile. |
| `attestation_signing_key` | required | 32-byte Ed25519 seed as hex, or `env:NAME` to read it from the daemon environment. Its matching public key is pinned in the Cosmos client profile. |

The client profile also pins `attestation_head` (`unsafe`, `safe`, or
`finalized`). The relayer's `head_kind` must match it. The daemon signs the
requested head into each attestation, so a signature issued for a lower head
cannot be replayed to a stricter client that uses the same public key.

`server` block: `port` serves Prometheus on `/metrics`; `grpc_port` serves the
sidecar API (0/omitted disables either).

### Trust levels

`attestation_head` picks the speed/assurance point:

| Head | Derived from | Latency | Verdicts |
|---|---|---|---|
| `finalized` (default) | **Finalized L1 data** — "tx finality", irreversible | ~20–40 min | Confirmed immediately |
| `safe` | L1 data, but the L1 block may still reorg before finality | Faster | Provisional until the finalized recheck |
| `unsafe` | **Sequencer gossip** | Seconds | Provisional (sequencer trust) until the finalized recheck |

Anything attested below the finalized head is **provisional**: re-derived
automatically once finalized covers it, corrected + alarmed
(`head_divergence_total`) on contradiction — the finalized result always
wins. Consumers opt in via `include_provisional` and must treat provisional
roots as reversible.

## Replica setup (op-node + op-reth)

The attestor's guarantee is "**my own** replica derived this from L1" — the
replica must be operator-owned, same host or private network. The attestor
only talks to op-node's RPC (no public provider exposes those methods
anyway). Follow the official
[run-a-node-from-source guide](https://docs.optimism.io/operators/node-operators/tutorials/run-node-from-source)
for version-current commands; below is the attestor-relevant summary (checked
2026-07-22).

**Execution client**: **op-reth** — op-geth reached end-of-support 2026-05-31
and cannot follow OP Mainnet past the Karst hardfork. (The attestor is
EL-agnostic; it only queries op-node.)

**Prerequisites**: an L1 execution RPC + an L1 beacon API serving blob
sidecars (blobs expire after ~18 days — a snapshot older than that can't
derive the gap without an archive blob source). Hardware: ≥16 GB RAM, ~700 GB
SSD for OP Mainnet (+~100 GB / 6 months). **No archive mode anywhere** — the
attestor only needs proofs at blocks ~30 min to a couple of days old, served
by a full node via the proof window below. Snap sync is fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git && cd optimism
git checkout op-node/v1.18.2          # latest coordinated release tag
cd op-node && just && cd ..
cd rust/op-reth && cargo build --release --bin op-reth && cd ../..
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt

# Execution layer:
./rust/target/release/op-reth node \
  --chain=optimism --datadir=$DATADIR --http --ws \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --rpc.eth-proof-window=100000

# Derivation driver (the endpoint the attestor uses):
./op-node/bin/op-node \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND --l1.beacon=$L1_BEACON_URL \
  --l2=ws://localhost:8551 --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt --l2.enginekind=reth \
  --network=op-mainnet --syncmode=execution-layer \
  --rpc.addr=127.0.0.1 --rpc.port=9545
```

Notes the generic guide won't tell you:

- **`--rpc.eth-proof-window` matters**: `optimism_outputAtBlock` uses
  `eth_getProof` of the `L2ToL1MessagePasser`, served only inside this
  window. Proposals commit to ~1 h-old blocks, verdicts wait for the
  finalized head, restarts re-verify older pending games — size it for the
  worst-case lag (`100000` ≈ 2.3 days at 2 s; flag since op-reth v2.2.3).
  Symptom of too-small: `optimism_outputAtBlock` errors on old pending games
  while fresh ones attest fine.
- **Unsafe mode needs p2p** (on by default in op-node) — the unsafe head
  comes from sequencer gossip. Safe/finalized work with p2p off.
- **Keep op-node's RPC private** (bind 127.0.0.1 / firewall); sequencer mode
  stays off — the replica must remain a pure verifier.
- Snap sync takes hours; the attestor can run during sync — everything stays
  `pending` until the heads catch up (designed fail-safe posture).

Ready check — all three heads present and advancing on repeated calls:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"optimism_syncStatus","params":[]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:9545 | jq '.result | {unsafe: .unsafe_l2.number, safe: .safe_l2.number, finalized: .finalized_l2.number}'
```

## Deployment topology (sidecar + gRPC)

The attestor runs as a **standalone sidecar** co-located with the replica;
the relayer consumes the feed over gRPC — the same consume-a-verifier
relationship it has with the prover.

```
[L1 node] ← derives ← [op-node + op-reth replica] ← RPC ← [attestor binary] ← gRPC ← [relayer start]
                       (same host / private net)          feed + metrics          (op_to_cosmos, future)
```

- `server.grpc_port` enables the API (plaintext gRPC — localhost or private
  network only); HTTP metrics stays on `server.port`.
- Service definition: `proto/attestor/attestor.proto` (regenerate via
  `buf.gen.attestor.yaml`; generated code is never hand-edited). Methods:
  `Info`, `AttestedUpTo`, `AttestedRootAtOrBelow`, `WatchAttested` — see the
  [README](README.md#grpc-api-attestorattestorservice).
- All API methods are read-only; the attestation loop is the only writer.
- Smoke: `grpcurl -plaintext localhost:3001 attestor.AttestorService/Info`.

## Healthy operation

First start logs `bootstrapped ingest cursor at game index N of M`; restarts
resume from `state_path` instead. Then, in order of appearance:

- `ingested proposal: game …` as the factory window is scanned (OP Mainnet
  proposes ≈ 1 game/hour);
- `replica_finalized_head` climbing on `/metrics`, `attestation_lag_blocks`
  falling;
- `derived root attested at l2 block …` every derived gap once the gating
  head is covered — this is the feed the relay path consumes;
- `attested game N …` roughly hourly — the proposal watchdog agreeing with
  the proposer.

Query the feed the way the relayer will:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{}' 127.0.0.1:3001 attestor.AttestorService/Info
grpcurl -plaintext -d '{"src_chain":"op-mainnet"}' 127.0.0.1:3001 attestor.AttestorService/AttestedUpTo
```

With **no replica reachable**, the correct posture is: proposals ingest,
`pending` fills, `attestation pass failed (nothing affirmed, retrying in …)`
with backoff 1 m → 15 m, feed stays empty. Nothing is ever affirmed by a down
or lagging replica.

### Fail-safe invariants

What "healthy" rests on — the attestor fails toward *unaffirmed*, never
toward *wrong*:

- The ingest cursor **never advances** past a failed fetch.
- A game leaves `pending` only via an **explicit verdict** — replica errors
  keep it pending forever.
- A down or lagging replica **affirms nothing**; games pile up in pending by
  design (visible as `attestation_lag_blocks`).
- State is one **atomic-rename JSON file**; a corrupt file fails loudly at
  startup. Delete it to re-bootstrap — re-attesting old games is safe,
  silently resetting is not.

## Low-latency operation — the fastest safe profile

To serve a fresh root within seconds of L2 block production:

```json
"attestation_head": "unsafe",
"poll_interval_seconds": 2,
"derived_attestation_gap_blocks": 5
```

Measured on the local devnet: with gap 1 the feed attested every consecutive
L2 block ~1–2 s after production. **Gap 5–10 (10–20 s) is the recommended
production setting** — near-identical freshness with a 5–10× smaller
provisional backlog (provisional entries are never pruned, and each
finalized-recheck confirmation is a separate state-file write).

What keeps this fast profile safe — all four are load-bearing:

1. **Local execution still checks the block**: the replica executes every
   unsafe payload via the engine API, so an invalid state transition is
   rejected at your own node. What unsafe does NOT yet check: data
   availability and sequencer equivocation.
2. **Provisional is a contract, not a label**: every unsafe-head root is
   served `provisional=true` until the finalized re-derivation confirms it —
   consumers opt in explicitly and never use provisional roots for
   irreversible downstream effects.
3. **The finalized recheck is authoritative**: ~15–40 min later every
   provisional entry is re-derived from finalized L1; contradiction corrects
   the feed and fires the alarm. Ethereum finality is the floor no config can
   move — "fast" means fast *provisional*, not fast finality.
4. **Alert on `head_divergence_total`**: in this profile it is your only
   early-warning signal for sequencer equivocation. Non-zero = incident; stop
   consuming provisional roots until understood.

Operational requirements: op-node p2p enabled, and mind the L1 RPC rate —
every poll tick calls `gameCount()` (2 s poll ≈ 43k L1 calls/day; fine on
your own node, meterable on a provider).

## Failure drills

Run these before trusting a deployment — each must leave the feed
*unaffirmed rather than wrong*:

- **Restart**: kill mid-run and restart. Must resume from the state file —
  same cursor, same pending set, no re-affirmation, no skipped games. A
  corrupt state file fails loudly at startup; deleting it re-bootstraps from
  the lookback window (re-attesting old games is safe).
- **Mismatch / alarm path**: don't wait for a real invalid proposal — run a
  mock op-node (a ~20-line JSON-RPC stub answering `optimism_syncStatus` with
  huge heads and `optimism_outputAtBlock` with junk; same shape as
  `newFakeOpNode` in `opstack/replica_test.go`), point `op_node_rpc_url` at
  it, set `"disable_derived_roots": true` so the junk can't enter the feed as
  derived roots. Every pending game must log `OUTPUT ROOT MISMATCH`,
  increment `roots_mismatched_total`, and land in the state file's
  `mismatches` — with the attested feed staying empty.
- **Unsafe/safe mode**: against a real replica, attestations appear
  `provisional=true` (+`roots_provisional_total`), then
  `finalized head confirmed …` clears the flag. `head_divergence_total` must
  stay 0 on a healthy chain; non-zero means finalized derivation contradicted
  a provisional result (sequencer divergence at unsafe, an L1 reorg at
  safe) — treat as an incident.
- **Replica outage**: stop the op-node mid-run. Pending freezes (no verdicts,
  no cursor movement), `replica_errors_total{kind="rpc"}` climbs, backoff
  engages; everything resumes untouched when the replica returns.

## Local devnet testing

The fastest way to see real verdicts (minutes, no mainnet sync):

```bash
./scripts/local/run_op_stack.sh          # full local OP Stack via Kurtosis:
                                         # L1 + sequencer + replica + proposer
                                         # posting real dispute games every 60s
source .op-devnet-run/attestor.env
./scripts/local/run_op_attestor.sh       # attestor against the devnet replica
```

`run_op_attestor.sh` also does production bring-up: point it at an existing
replica with `OP_NODE_RPC_URL=...`, or let it start op-reth + op-node itself
(`OP_RETH_BIN`/`OP_NODE_BIN`). It resolves the factory + game type fresh from
the chain via `cast`, generates the config, and health-checks metrics + gRPC.
Knobs: `ATTESTATION_HEAD`, `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, `DERIVED_GAP_BLOCKS`,
`METRICS_PORT`, `GRPC_PORT`, `ATTESTOR_RUN_DIR` — see the script header. Prefer
`ATTESTOR_RUN_DIR` over the legacy `RUN_DIR`: the devnet bring-up scripts use
`RUN_DIR` for their own artifacts, so exporting it into a shared shell sends
their package clones and handoffs into the attestor's directory.

Cheaper live-verdict environment than mainnet: an **OP Sepolia** replica
syncs far faster. Same config shape — but read that chain's factory address
and `respectedGameType()` first; both differ per chain.

Pure ingest smoke with no replica at all: public L1 RPC + a dead
`op_node_rpc_url` port — proposals ingest and everything stays pending (the
[fail-safe posture](#fail-safe-invariants)).
