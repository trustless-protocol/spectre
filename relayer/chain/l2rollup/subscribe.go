// A standalone poll-based L2 event listener (deliberately NOT the ETH
// subscriber.SubscribeEth, which is bound to the L1 endpoint + BatchBuilder via
// shared context). It polls eth_getLogs on the L2 RPC for the ICS26Router
// SendPacket / WriteAcknowledgement events of this source's client id, decodes them
// with the shared ICS26Router bindings, and drives the adapter handler with its own
// pending buffer for re-queued (not-yet-relayable) events. Within one run the cursor is
// gap-recovery-safe: it only advances past a range that scanned successfully, so an RPC
// hiccup re-scans rather than skips (mistake #11).
//
// The cursor is NOT persisted across runs — it lives only in Subscribe's stack frame.
// A restart resumes one startup window below the head (see below), so anything older
// than that window is never re-scanned, and a packet whose acknowledgement fell outside
// it stays pending forever with nothing in the log to say why. The window is a
// DURATION converted to blocks at the chain's measured block time, so a fast chain gets
// more blocks for the same amount of recovery time rather than less time for the same
// number of blocks.
//
// LIMITATION (unsafe head-kind): the cursor only moves FORWARD — it never rewinds on an
// L2 reorg. With head_kind=unsafe a scanned block can be reorged out and replaced; an
// event only present on the losing branch is then missed (the cursor already passed
// it). This is a non-issue for safe/finalized head-kinds (the relayable frontier is
// post-reorg), which is the reason unsafe is the lowest-trust setting.

	//
	// That distinction is the whole point of the constant. 256 blocks is ~8.5

	// sizes at TWO blocks, and a packet emitted ten blocks -- and seconds --
	// before the restart falls outside the startup scan. Nothing persists this
	// cursor (see line 29), so that packet is never rediscovered. Found in
	// review.
	//
	// The cap is not a guess at any chain's block time; it is the point past
	// which a measurement stops being usable. Erring low is the safe direction
	// and the same one fallbackBlockTime already takes: under-estimating the
	// block time over-estimates the block count, and a window that is too large

// SafeBlockNumber or FinalizedBlockNumber, not the chain tip. Both ends of
// "head minus window" therefore live in the same delayed view, so the finality
// lag is already absorbed. Across an outage of D the finalized head advances by
// D/blockTime blocks, which is exactly what a window of D covers. A packet still
// above the finalized head at restart has not entered that view at all, and the
// running loop scans it when the head reaches it.
//
// Adding a per-head-kind lag on top would make every finalized run pay for one
// case that is not a crash: an operator CHANGING head_kind between runs. Going
// from finalized to unsafe moves the anchor forward by the finality lag, leaving
// [old finalized head, new unsafe head - window] unscanned. That is a real gap

// The key was not just renamed, it changed UNITS: it used to name a block count
// and now names a duration. So an old value cannot be honoured even in
// principle -- "256" read as a duration is not 256 blocks, it is a parse error,
// and "256s" would be a window the operator never asked for. Carrying it forward
// would be guessing at intent.
//
// Refusing is the other half of the same argument. An environment variable that
// used to size the crash-recovery window and now does nothing is exactly the
// failure NFR 10 forbids: the relayer would start, run on the default 8m32s, and
// the operator would learn about it only when a packet older than that window
// was never re-scanned. There is nothing to deploy against yet, so this is a
// removal that says so, not a deprecation window.
