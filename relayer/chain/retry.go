// This file is the third error class. §3.6 of the component design says there
// are three, and the code had two: Retryable and Permanent (see errors.go).
//
// The missing one is "not enough resources": out of gas, batch too large,
// provider refusing a log range. It is the easiest of the three to get wrong,
// and both wrong answers cost real money:
//
//   - filed as TRANSIENT and retried unchanged, it is not a retry at all, it is
//     an infinite loop that burns fees and sequence numbers and blocks every
//     packet behind it;
//   - filed as PERMANENT, a perfectly valid packet is dead-lettered and its
//     escrow stays locked.
//
// So the class carries its own remedy. A retry that cannot say what it will do
// differently is not in this class.

// Outcome is which of the three classes a failure belongs to.
