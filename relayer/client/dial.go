// DefaultRPCTimeout is the transport-level ceiling on a single JSON-RPC round
// trip. It is a LIVENESS BACKSTOP, not a latency target: neither library we
// dial supplies one of its own, so without it a node that accepts the TCP
// connection and then stops answering blocks the caller forever.
//
// That is not hypothetical here. The relay loops drive one direction on a
// single goroutine, so one unanswered request wedges that whole direction with
// no error, no retry and nothing in the log — the first row of the failure
// table in the local-devnet runbook. See GetEthMembershipProof for the same
// hazard caught at a call site.
//
// It is deliberately much larger than Config.FetchTimeout (15s). FetchTimeout
// bounds calls we expect to be fast; this bounds every call, including ones
// that are legitimately slow — a wide eth_getLogs scan, an eth_getProof against
// an archive node, a paginated TxSearch over a long recovery range. Set it low
// enough to be a useful SLO and it starts cancelling healthy work, which is a
// worse failure than the one it prevents. Two minutes is far beyond any healthy
// response and far below "forever".

// DialCosmosRPC connects to a CometBFT node with a bounded HTTP client.

// The timeout applies ONLY to the HTTP JSON-RPC calls (Status, TxSearch,
// ABCIQuery, Commit, Validators, Block). It does not reach the WebSocket
// subscription: NewWithClient passes the http.Client to the JSON-RPC caller and
// builds WSEvents separately via newWSEvents, which dials its own long-lived
// connection (cometbft rpc/client/http/http.go:132-152). A timeout that killed
// the subscription would silently undo the live-path fix in #377, so this
// separation is load-bearing rather than incidental.

// cometLogger routes CometBFT's structured logger into the standard logger the

//
// It is not cosmetic. The two failures that decide whether the live
// subscription is alive are reported ONLY through this interface, and the
// client's logger is a nop until SetLogger is called — which nothing in this
// repository did:
//
//	rpc/client/http/http.go, WSEvents.redoSubscriptionsAfter
//	    "Failed to resubscribe"                                     <- resubscribe gave up
//	rpc/client/http/http.go, WSEvents.eventListener
//	    "wanted to publish ResultEvent, but out channel is full"    <- an event was DROPPED
//
// Both are silent losses: neither closes the Go channel the subscriber selects
// on, so without this adapter a subscription can stop delivering and leave no
// trace in any log. See cosmosLiveEventBuffer in subscriber/event.go for the
// drop, and the resubscribe path for the other.
//
// Scope note: rpchttp builds its inner WSClient before SetLogger can reach it
// (newWSEvents calls w.ws.SetLogger(w.Logger) with the nop), so this covers the
// WSEvents layer — where both lines above live — and not the transport layer
// below it.
