// This file answers one question about an eth_getLogs failure: did the provider
// refuse because we asked for too much?
//
// It matters because the answer decides between two opposite actions. A provider
// that is momentarily unavailable is fixed by waiting; a provider that caps the
// span is fixed only by asking for less, and waiting on it repeats the identical
// rejected request forever. Both arrive as an opaque JSON-RPC error.

// units an operator reads in a log line.

// logRangeRejectionPhrases are the ways providers say "that range, or its result
// set, was too large". They are matched case-insensitively against the error text
// because no provider reports this in a structured field -- the comment on
// l2rollup's logScanChunk already records the shape: a plain 400 that names
// neither the setting nor a workable value.

// Several providers answer a rate limit with the same JSON-RPC code (-32005) they
// use for a range limit, which is why the code is never consulted here. A rate
// limit read as a range rejection would shrink the scan to a single block and
// then, at the bottom of the ladder, be reported permanent -- turning "wait a
// moment" into a recovery scan that is abandoned. The asymmetry is deliberate:
// these are checked first and win.

// the safe direction — the cost of missing one is a scan that keeps failing
// visibly, while the cost of a false positive is a scan narrowed to nothing and

// LogSpan is the block span one eth_getLogs asks for, narrowed in place when a

// narrowing SURVIVES the tick that discovered it. Rediscovering the provider's
// cap every tick would also work, but it spends a rejected request each time and
// hides the cap from the log after the first line. Each scan loop owns its own
// LogSpan on one goroutine, so it carries no lock; that ownership is stated at
// each declaration.
