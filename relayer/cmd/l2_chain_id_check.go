// Until this existed the field was inert: nothing in the relayer read it, and
// nothing in the Rust verifier reads it either (it is declared in CommonProfile
// and never consulted). Transactions take their chain id from eth_chainId on the
// RPC itself, so a profile naming the devnet while the RPC pointed at Arbitrum
// Sepolia relayed happily against Sepolia — with the config, the created
// client's committed profile, and the docs all saying otherwise. `l2_chain_id`
// is documented as "must be the chain the relayer's l2_rpc_url actually serves"
// (relayer/op-l2-config.example.json) and listed as a hand-filled field for
// every L2 in docs/E2E.md, so an operator reasonably assumes a wrong value is
// caught. This is what catches it.
//
// A NON-ANSWERING endpoint does not fail this configuration comparison. That is
// an availability problem, not evidence that rollup_profile is wrong, so this
// check reports it as unknown rather than as a mismatch. The startup EVM signer
// lock separately requires eth_chainId before it can identify the nonce domain;
// it will stop startup rather than silently run without that lock. Only a
// definite disagreement here — the endpoint answered, and answered with a
// different chain — is a configuration error, because no amount of retrying
// fixes it and every packet relayed meanwhile is relayed against the wrong chain.
