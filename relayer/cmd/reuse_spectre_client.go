// same address held byte-identical SpectreClient code on both Base and OP.

// It is also not enough to compare chain ids. A local devnet re-created by
// run_cosmos_node.sh keeps its chain-id ("test-ibc-eth"), so a client pinned to
// the previous incarnation looks correct by name while trusting a height and a
