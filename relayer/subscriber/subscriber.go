// This file holds what both directions share: the Subscriber itself, the
// dependency structs, the recovery-cursor helpers and the event-name constants.
//
// The two directions live in cosmos.go and ethereum.go. They were one 1734-line
// file whose function names already spelled out the symmetry --
// resumeCosmosCursor / resumeEthCursors, subscribeCosmosOnce / subscribeEthOnce,
// recoverCosmosGapToLatest / recoverEthGapToLatest -- while the layout did not,
// so the mirror check that non-functional requirement #5 asks for meant scrolling
// eight hundred lines rather than diffing two files.

// here means we catch any tx that produces a send_packet (whether triggered by
// gaiad's MsgTransfer wrapper, a direct channeltypesv2.MsgSendPacket from a test
// harness, or any other module that ends up calling the v2 channel keeper), instead

// cosmosLiveEventBuffer is the per-subscription channel depth requested from

//	select {
//	case out <- *result:
//	default:
//	    w.Logger.Error("wanted to publish ResultEvent, but out channel is full", ...)

// logger unless SetLogger is called -- so a dropped packet leaves no trace
// anywhere. Meanwhile this subscriber's consuming goroutine also runs the 30s
// gap-recovery scan (several paginated TxSearch calls) in the same select, so it
// stops reading for seconds at a time, every 30 seconds.
//
// The Ethereum side does not need this: go-ethereum's generated watcher sends
// blocking and its RPC client queues 20,000 events before failing loudly with
// ErrSubscriptionQueueOverflow, which subscribeEthOnce already surfaces.

// comes from Status.SyncInfo.LatestBlockHeight, which is set when the block
// commits; the results come from TxSearch, which reads the tx indexer -- and the
// indexer is a SEPARATE goroutine consuming the event bus after commit
// (cometbft state/txindex/indexer_service.go). So a tx in the newest block is
// routinely committed but not yet indexed.
//
// That race loses the packet permanently, because the scan then advances the
// cursor past the height it just failed to read:
//
//	latest := Status()                    // 202195, committed
//	TxSearch(..., "tx.height <= 202195")  // indexer has not written 202195 yet -> empty
//	cursor = 202195 + 1                   // 202195 is never scanned again
//
// and it is silent: an empty scan increments nothing, so nothing is logged.
// Observed on a live devnet -- one Cosmos->Base transfer at height 202195 was
// never relayed and never timed out, leaving its funds escrowed.
//
// Two blocks is far more than the indexer needs (its lag is milliseconds) and
// costs the backstop about ten seconds of extra detection delay. Rescanning is
