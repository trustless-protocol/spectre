// The nested drains must not share a budget. A source drains its own goroutines
// inside the drain the relay module runs over the source; with equal timeouts
// both expire on the same cancellation at the same moment, and whether the module
// observes the stuck worker or sees its subscriber return first is a race.
//
// This is an invariant rather than a behaviour test on purpose: reproducing the
// race takes the real timeouts, and the property that prevents it is one
// comparison. Reported by @DongLieu on #434.
