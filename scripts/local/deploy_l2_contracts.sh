# Deploys the L2-side receive infrastructure (E2ETestDeployL2) to a running local
# rollup's exec layer and patches the relayer's cosmos_to_l2 module with the
# resulting addresses + L2 endpoint. This is the L2 twin of deploy_eth_contracts.sh:
# same deploy-then-patch shape, but it targets the L2 exec RPC and the cosmos_to_l2
# module (a SpectreClient on the L2), and it runs E2ETestDeployL2 (no ERC20 faucet).
#
# Like the L1 flow it is DEPLOY-ONLY: the SpectreClient itself is created afterwards
# by `relayer create-clients-eth --source <ics26_client_id>`, which reads a fresh
# Cosmos genesis and writes spectre_client back into the module.
#
# Endpoint source (in priority order):
#   1. L2_RPC in the environment (explicit deploy override)
#   2. L2_ENV_FILE, if set, is sourced and its L2_RPC_URL used
#   3. the stack handoff for DST_CHAIN is sourced automatically:
#        opstack   -> .op-devnet-run/attestor.env       (L2_RPC_URL)
#        arbitrum  -> .arbitrum-devnet-run/attestor.env  (L2_RPC_URL)
#        base      -> .base-devnet-run/attestor.env      (L2_RPC_URL)
#
# If L2_ENV_FILE is set explicitly, it is sourced even when L2_RPC is already set.
# L2_RPC/L2_WS still win for deployment; the unconditional source lets the relayer
# consume extra handoff variables such as Base's follower RPC/WS pair.
#
# The relayer config can use a different execution endpoint from deployment.
# Local Base writes L2_FOLLOWER_RPC_URL/L2_FOLLOWER_WS_URL for base-client, which
# serves historical eth_getProof. The sequencer RPC is still correct for sending
# the deployment transactions, but not for packet membership proofs.
#
# Env:
#   DST_CHAIN (opstack)                 which cosmos_to_l2 module to patch
#                                       (matched on src_chain=cosmos + dst_chain)
#   MODULE_NAME                         patch the module with this `name` instead.
#                                       Needed for Base: it runs the OP Stack, so
#                                       its modules carry dst_chain=opstack and are
#                                       indistinguishable from Optimism's by chain
#                                       alone. Set MODULE_NAME=cosmos-to-base.

# rollup_profile.common.l2_router. Patching only the forward module left the
# example placeholder (0x7777…) in place — a valid-looking address, so it failed
# far downstream as a membership-proof error against an account that does not
# exist, rather than as "you did not set the router". The two modules are joined
