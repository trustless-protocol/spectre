# Helpers for local 08-wasm proposal scripts.
#
# Why these derive the checksum instead of reading one out of the chain's list:
#
# `gaiad q ibc-wasm checksums` returns a collections.KeySet, which paginates in
# ASCENDING KEY ORDER — sorted by checksum bytes, not by when each was stored. So
# neither `.checksums[0]` nor `.checksums[-1]` reliably names the wasm a script
# just stored; which one happens to be right depends on how the hashes sort
# against every other wasm already on the chain.
#
# That is not a display bug. The printed value is what the operator pastes into
# `create-clients-cosmos --wasm-checksum` / `--l2-config`, so picking the wrong
# entry creates the client with ANOTHER client's wasm code. The failure then
# lands much later and names the wrong thing:
#
#   deserializing client state failed: missing field chain_id
#
# — the Ethereum client's code rejecting an L2 profile, which sends you debugging
# the profile instead of the checksum that selected the wrong code.
#
# The checksum is just the sha256 of the UNCOMPRESSED wasm, so computing it from
# the proposal is exact and independent of what else is stored.
